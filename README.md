# Enterprise-Design-Thinking-Cloud-Computing-Project (IBM-Cloud-Garage-Methodology)
In this project exercise, we used EDT framework on Mural tool to help a luxury fashion brand to incorporate AR (Augmented Reality) technology using mobile smart phones (i/OS & Android) running on hybrid clouds to enhance their online customers shopping experience in view of the Covid-19 restriction on border closure, where their loyal group of customers are not able to shop in their flagship stores at Paris, NYC and Milan.
